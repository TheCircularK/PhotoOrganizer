# Photo Organizer

A simple GTK4 project written with Python. It will organize photos according to my totally arbitrary pattern.

### How to Use

Photo Organizer is simple.

- Select a source directory — this is where you have the photos you would like to organize.
- Select "Rename" if you would like to rename your photos according to the pattern YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-MS.whatever
- Select "Organize" if you would like to organize your photos by their date taken, stored in their EXIF data. They will be organized into directories like "2025/03-March" in the target directory. By default, this program will organize in place.
- Select "Dry run" if you would like to see what changes will take place without actually changing anything.
